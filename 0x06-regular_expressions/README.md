## Introduction

This project is part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum and focuses on Regular Expressions (regex). It involves building and using regular expressions using the Oniguruma library, which is the default regex library used by Ruby. The project consists of creating Ruby scripts that match specific patterns using regular expressions.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into several tasks, each requiring the creation of a Ruby script that matches a particular regular expression pattern. These tasks help develop a strong understanding of regular expressions and their practical applications. The tasks include:

1. **Simply Matching School**: Creating a regex to match the word "School."
2. **Repetition Token #0**: Finding a regex pattern for repetition.
3. **Repetition Token #1**: Building a regex pattern for repetition.
4. **Repetition Token #2**: Creating a regex for more repetition.
5. **Repetition Token #3**: Developing a regex pattern for repetition without square brackets.
6. **Not Quite HBTN Yet**: Designing a regex for strings that start with "h," end with "n," and have any single character in between.
7. **Call Me Maybe**: Crafting a regex to match 10-digit phone numbers.
8. **OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**: Creating a regex that matches capital letters.
9. **TextMe (Advanced)**: Writing a script to extract sender, receiver, and flag information from log messages.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project, I learned the following key concepts and skills:

- How to create and use regular expressions (regex).
- Practical applications of regular expressions in text pattern matching.
- Working with the Oniguruma regex library in Ruby.
- Scripting in Ruby to apply regular expressions.
- Enhancing my problem-solving skills by solving regex-related challenges.

## Importance of This Project

Regular expressions are a fundamental tool for software engineers, especially for tasks like text parsing, data extraction, and validation. This project provides hands-on experience in working with regular expressions, which are commonly used in real-world scenarios by system administrators, DevOps professionals, and software developers.

## Resources

To complete this project, I utilized the following resources:

- [Regular expressions - basics](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)
- [Regular expressions - advanced](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp)
- [Rubular](http://rubular.com/): A useful tool for testing Ruby regular expressions.
- [Regex101](https://regex101.com/): An online regex testing and debugging tool.
- Project-specific instructions provided by ALX.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- `0x06-regular_expressions/`: The main project directory containing individual Ruby scripts for each task.
- `README.md`: This project README file.
- `LICENSE`: The project's open-source license file.

## How to Use This Repository

To use this repository and complete the Regular Expressions project tasks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
   git clone https://github.com/fazzy12/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
```
2. Navigate to the 0x06-regular_expressions/ directory:

```
   `cd` alx-system_engineering-devops/0x06-regular_expressions/
```
3. Inside the `0x06-regular_expressions/` directory, you will find Ruby script files for each task 
(e.g., `0-simply_match_school.rb`, `1-repetition_token_0.rb`, etc.).

4. Run the Ruby scripts with appropriate arguments as per the task instructions.

5. Check the output to verify if the scripts correctly match the specified patterns using regular expressions.

6. Complete each task and ensure that the regex patterns work as expected.
