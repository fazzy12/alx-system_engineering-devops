# Project Title: Attack is the Best Defense

## Concept
In this project, we will explore the concepts of network basics, Docker, and hacking techniques such as ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic. The goal is to understand the potential vulnerabilities in network security and learn how to protect against malicious attacks.

## Background
This project is optional and will not affect your overall course grade negatively if not completed. However, completing any part of the project will add to your average grade.

## Resources

#### Read or watch:
* Network sniffing
* ARP spoofing
* Connect to SendGridâ€™s SMTP relay using telnet
* What is Docker and why is it popular?
* Dictionary attack
#### man or help:

* tcpdump
* hydra
* telnet
* docker

## Tasks
* ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic

* Dictionary attack on a SSH server

* Reverse engineering an ELF file

### Deadline
This project must be completed by Dec 19, 2022 6:00 AM. An auto review will be launched at the deadline.

## Additional Information
This project is designed to challenge your understanding of network security and hacking techniques. It is important to note that these skills should only be used for ethical purposes and never for malicious attacks.

Project Description
In this project, we will explore the concept of "attack is the best defense" and how it applies to DevOps and scripting. We will use tools and techniques such as Docker and scripting languages to secure systems and protect against malicious attacks.
