# Web Stack Debugging Project - Level 0

## Description

The goal of this project is to debug a web stack by resolving issues that prevent Apache from serving a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of the server.

## Concepts

This project covers the following concepts:

- Network basics
- Docker
- Web stack debugging

## Background Context

Debugging is a crucial skill for Full-Stack Software Engineers, as it allows them to identify and fix issues in a web stack. The project provides a broken/bugged web stack, and the objective is to manually fix the issues and then create a Bash script that automates the debugging steps.

## Example Scenario

### Given Information

A server must have a copy of the `/etc/passwd` file in `/tmp` and a file named `/tmp/isworking` containing the string "OK" for the web application to work.

### Debugging Steps

```
docker run -d -ti ubuntu:14.04
docker exec -ti <container_id> /bin/bash
cp /etc/passwd /tmp/
echo OK > /tmp/isworking
```

###  Docker Installation
For this project, you will be given a container to solve the task. If you want to install Docker on your local machine or VM, you can follow the installation instructions for:

- [Mac OS]()
- [Windows]()
- [Ubuntu 14.04]()
- [Ubuntu 16.04]()

### Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All files interpreted on `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`
- All files end with a new line
- `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Bash script files must be executable
- Bash scripts must pass `Shellcheck` without any error
- Bash scripts must run without error
- The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line of all Bash scripts should be a comment explaining the script's purpose

### Tasks
- **Task 0: Give me a page!**

In this task, the goal is to get Apache to run on the container and return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of the server.

### Example:
```
docker run -p 8080:80 -d -it holbertonschool/265-0
curl 0:8080
```

After connecting to the container and fixing the issues, running the curl command should return the expected page. Paste the command(s) used to fix the issue in your answer file.
