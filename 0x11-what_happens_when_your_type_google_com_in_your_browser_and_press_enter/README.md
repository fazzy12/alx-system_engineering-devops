# What happens when you type 'www.google.com' in your browser and press Enter

<p>This article is a task focused on technical writing as part of the ALX Africa Software Engineering program. The title of the post is "What happens when you type 'www.google.com' in your browser and press Enter." The post delves into the different steps and processes that happen behind the scenes when we visit a website. When you enter a website's address into your browser, it goes through a series of steps to ensure that the website appears on your screen. These steps include finding the correct server that the website is hosted on, checking for security threats and protecting sensitive information, and distributing traffic evenly among servers to ensure that the website is available and responsive to users. The post is aimed at providing a better understanding of how the internet and websites work, and the role that each component plays in the process.</p>

## Conclusion
<p>
In this article, we discussed the various technologies and protocols that are involved in the process of loading a website and how they work together to ensure that the website is properly loaded and displayed on the user's screen. These technologies and protocols include DNS request, TCP/IP, Firewall, HTTPS/SSL, Load-balancer, Web server, Application server, and Database. Each component plays a crucial role in the process, from ensuring that the browser's request is sent to the correct server to protecting the network from malicious attacks, to ensuring the website is reliable and available to the users. Understanding these technologies and protocols is essential for anyone who wants to have a better grasp of how the web functions.
