# Web Stack Debugging 4

## Overview

This project focuses on resolving various system configuration and performance issues in a web server environment. Specifically, it addresses the following challenges:

1. **Web Server Under Pressure**: Optimization of an Nginx web server configuration to handle a high number of requests efficiently.
2. **User Login Issue**: Resolving a system resource limitation issue preventing the `holberton` user from logging in.

The solutions are implemented using Puppet, a configuration management tool, to automate the setup and configuration changes required.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- **Directory**: `0x1B-web_stack_debugging_4`
- **Puppet Manifests**:
  - `0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp`: Optimizes the Nginx configuration.
  - `1-user_limit.pp`: Adjusts the system configuration to allow the `holberton` user to log in without encountering file descriptor limit errors.

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that Puppet is installed on your system.
- Clone the project repository from GitHub:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/alx-system_engineering-devops.git
    ```

Navigate to the 0x1B-web_stack_debugging_4 directory.

### Applying Puppet Manifests
To apply the Puppet manifests, use the following commands:

1. For optimizing the Nginx configuration:

```
puppet apply 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp
```
2. For adjusting the system configuration for the `holberton` user:
```
puppet apply 1-user_limit.pp
```
### Testing
After applying the Puppet manifests, it is essential to perform thorough testing to ensure that the issues are resolved and the system functions as expected.

- For the Nginx optimization, use ApacheBench or similar tools to benchmark the server performance before and after the changes.
- For the holberton user login issue, attempt to log in as the holberton user and verify that no errors related to file descriptor limits are encountered.

### Conclusion
By addressing the identified challenges and implementing the necessary configuration changes using Puppet, this project aims to enhance the reliability, performance, and usability of a web server environment. Regular monitoring and maintenance practices should be followed to ensure continued optimal performance and to address any emerging issues promptly.
